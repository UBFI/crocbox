# crocbox
Jailbreak your IOS device with checkra1n with only a keycroc and a power bank.


To install ensure your croc is connected to wifi and run
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UBFI/crocbox/main/install.sh | bash
```
To operate first ensure you have booted your device into DFU mode and connect it to the keycroc shortly after that you will see the checkrain loader and you have sucessfully jailbroken ios this will only work on currently fully supported versions of ios but with a bit of fiddling with the launch arguments you can get it working fine i havent done it hear because i feel like anyone that would want to run unsupported can do a bit of digging to find out how to do it
